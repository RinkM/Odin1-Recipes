<p>
    It had taken generations, but the weather engineers had flipped the switch, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
    Below the Imbrium Dome, clouds formed, swirling in a light wind. Once they gathered, droplets of water started to fall onto the city streets below.
    For the first time since anyone could remember, people could smell rain on asphalt. 
</p>
<p>In celebration for the occasion, a Gala event was held in the Imbrium Park square.  Party-goers were given umbrellas with the IVC logo printed on them.
    At the end of the night, an auction would be held to auction off some of the early technological relics that helped create this moment.

    <li>An old piece of the spaceship.</li>
