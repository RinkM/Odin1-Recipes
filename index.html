    <p>The adventure started the day it rained on <a href="moon.html">the Moon.</a>
    </div></p>
    <p>It had taken generations, but the weather engineers had flipped the switch, so to speak.</p>
    
    <p>Below the Imbrium Dome, clouds formed, swirling in a light wind. Once they gathered, droplets of water started to fall onto the city streets below.

    It was the first generation to smell rain on wet asphalt.
