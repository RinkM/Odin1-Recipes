<p>First thing to remember:
    </p> <p> 
    The moon is under the control of the InnerVersal Corporation
    
    <!--SOME NAMES... ENRON HALIBURTON SPACEX AMAZON -->
    The founders had the obsessive idea to fill the sea of storms with water from Titan. As the only source of water on the moon, IVC quickly became one of the wealthiest corporations in the System. 
        
    <p>Controlling the water meant controlling the food.</p>
